<p>I know you have probably heard about Alt School Africa and the incredulous job they are doing by creating a seismic shift in the way learning is perceived and consumed in the continent. They have successfully built a fully-virtual platform where Africans, regardless of who they are can access global standard learning resources.

     Okay, I am sure you can easily decode this writer is a current scholar at Alt School Africa so let's get right into it. Tech wasn't really my thing when I was a kid as I can confidently say reading, writing, seeking wisdom & football(I'm a Manchester United fan) are the things I live for.</p>
     
     <p>
        I briefly attended Satson School in Alapere Ketu, Lagos before completing my primary education at Jufhope Nursery & Primary School in Ogun State. Secondary level saw another change of fortune which meant I finished at Itoki Community High School, Ogun State & I wrote my West African Examinations Council (WAEC) exams in 2009.

        To be fair, I’ve always been fascinated by the internet and how it works but my love for reading and writing made me choose Mass Communication when it was time for tertiary education. I applied & got an admission to study my preferred course at Moshood Abiola Polytechnic (MAPOLY), got my National Diploma and that was the end of an another memorable experience.

        <h3>Why Alt School?</h3>
      A lot of water passed under the bridge after tertiary education and life wasn't as rosy as I imagined but I figured I should revive my interest in writing and the internet obsession so I created a <a href="https://olumidelawal.blogspot.com" target="_blank">blog</a>, writing match reports, opinion pieces and basically what’s on my mind. In the coming months, my goals at this prodigious learning platform is to become a competent software developer while making sure I excel in merging my love for football and internet into creating a viable product that will be groundbreaking, widely accepted and financially successful.
